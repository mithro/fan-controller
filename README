This repository contains details about building and controlling the Geoff's
"Intelligent Fan Controller".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From http://geoffg.net/fancontroller.html

The Intelligent Fan Controller is designed to control the noise generated
by the fans inside your computer. It does this by varying their speed based
on temperatures measured inside the case. When it is cool the fans will run
slowly and they will only speed up when needed... when your computer is
running hot.

Anyone with a noisy computer, especially a Media Centre system in the
lounge room, will benefit from this project. After installing this device,
my computer is now so quiet that I can hardly tell that it is running - and
that is a blessed relief.  

The main features are:
 * Configurable speed control based on temperatures measured inside
 * Control up to eight fans and measure up to four temperatures
 * USB interface and Windows software for setup and monitoring
 * It will run independently without a host (once it has been configured)
 * Cheap - The cost for all the parts is about $48
